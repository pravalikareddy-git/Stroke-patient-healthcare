This code provides a structured approach to analyze and preprocess a healthcare dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks. It begins by loading the dataset using pandas and displaying essential information about its structure, including column names, data types, and the presence of missing values. The head() function reveals the first few rows, giving a glimpse of the data.

Next, the code uses seaborn to visualize the distribution of key categorical variables like Residence_type, work_type, and smoking_status through count plots. This helps understand the frequency and balance of categories. For continuous variables, such as avg_glucose_level, a histogram with a density curve is plotted to reveal its distribution pattern.

The data cleaning process involves addressing missing values in the bmi column by replacing them with the mean value. This step ensures the dataset remains complete and usable for analysis. Categorical columns are then encoded into numerical values using LabelEncoder from sklearn. While this method is efficient, it's essential to be cautious of introducing unintended ordinal relationships. The code also drops the id column, as it is irrelevant for analysis, ensuring a more streamlined dataset.

Finally, the cleaned and encoded dataset is saved as a new CSV file for future use. This preprocessed file is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, or any downstream tasks, marking a critical step in preparing raw data for meaningful insights.

code processes a healthcare dataset for analysis by loading the data, visualizing distributions of key variables, and cleaning it. Missing BMI values are replaced with the mean, categorical variables are encoded numerically, and irrelevant columns are removed. Visualizations like count plots and histograms help understand data patterns. Finally, the cleaned dataset is saved as a new CSV file, ready for further analysis or modeling.

code streamlines the preprocessing and visualization of a healthcare dataset. It begins by loading the dataset and using pandas to display its structure, including column names, data types, and missing values. A preview of the dataset's first few rows provides context about its content.

To explore the data, the code employs seaborn to visualize categorical variables like Residence_type, work_type, and smoking_status using count plots. These visualizations help identify category distributions and data balance. For continuous variables, such as avg_glucose_level, a histogram with a density curve reveals its overall distribution.

In the cleaning phase, missing values in the bmi column are handled by replacing them with the mean, ensuring data completeness without introducing biases. Categorical variables are converted into numeric format using LabelEncoder, enabling compatibility with machine learning algorithms. The id column, being non-informative for analysis, is removed to streamline the dataset.

The final step saves the preprocessed data to a CSV file, making it ready for further exploratory analysis, modeling, or other machine learning workflows. This code effectively prepares raw data for meaningful analysis while maintaining data integrity.
