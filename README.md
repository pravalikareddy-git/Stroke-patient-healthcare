This code performs a thorough initial exploration and cleaning of a dataset loaded from a CSV file, aiming to identify missing values, data types, unique categories,
and basic statistics for both numerical and categorical columns. It begins by examining key summary statistics, data structure, and unique values in specific columns,
particularly in the gender and smoking_status fields. It then checks for missing values, noting their counts and percentages, and provides two options to handle them: 
either by dropping rows with missing values in the bmi column or by filling these values with the mean. Additionally, the code identifies duplicate rows, which could indicate 
data redundancy. Moving into analysis, it calculates stroke rates by gender, finding the mean stroke occurrence for each gender, and computes the percentage of total stroke
cases by gender to reveal insights into stroke distribution. This setup efficiently prepares the data for more advanced analytics or modeling.The code is focused on data
exploration and preprocessing in the Python programming language, specifically using the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The main objective is to prepare 
a dataset for further analysis or machine learning by conducting an initial review of the data, identifying missing values, managing duplicates, and performing basic
statistical evaluations.
Key actions in the code include:
###Descriptive Statistics: Uses functions like describe() to summarize numerical and categorical data.
###Null Value Analysis: Examines the extent and percentage of missing data across columns.
###Unique Value Exploration: Identifies distinct categories in specific columns to understand categorical distributions.
###Data Cleaning: Provides options for handling missing values, either by dropping rows or filling missing values with the mean.
###Duplicate Detection: Checks for duplicate rows to avoid redundant data.
###Group-Based Analysis: Calculates stroke rates by gender using groupby(), providing insight into demographic patterns within the data.
The language used in the code is Python, with specific usage of Pandas functions and DataFrame manipulations. The code structure is modular and clean, combining exploration,
analysis, and data preparation for further processing
