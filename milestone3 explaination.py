This code demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for training and evaluating machine learning models on a healthcare dataset, focusing on predicting the likelihood of a stroke. The process begins by loading a preprocessed dataset, where the stroke column serves as the target variable (y), and all other columns are treated as features (X). This separation ensures that the models can focus on learning patterns from the features to predict the target. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split, with the training set used to train the models and the testing set reserved for evaluating their performance on unseen data.

To ensure that all models perform optimally, feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler. This step standardizes the data so that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is particularly important for models like Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression, as these models are sensitive to the scale of the input data. Without scaling, the performance of these models may be adversely affected.

Four machine learning models are defined and trained: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Logistic Regression. Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression are designed for predicting continuous values, with Ridge and Lasso adding regularization to the model to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. These models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.

Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification to predict whether a stroke occurred (1) or not (0). Its performance is evaluated using accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions, and a classification report, which provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Precision indicates how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive, recall measures how many actual positive cases were correctly identified, and F1-score balances precision and recall.

Each model is trained on the scaled training data and tested on the testing data to generate predictions. The workflow evaluates the models' suitability for the task and allows for a direct comparison of their performance. This systematic approach ensures that both regression and classification capabilities are explored, offering insights into which model is most effective for this specific dataset and problem.

code focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for a healthcare dataset to predict the likelihood of a stroke. It begins by loading the preprocessed dataset and separating the features (X) from the target variable (y), which indicates stroke occurrence. The data is split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for evaluation. To ensure optimal model performance, the features are standardized using StandardScaler, which scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
