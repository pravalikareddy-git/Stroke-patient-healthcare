The code provided is a comprehensive Python script for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It begins by importing these libraries, essential for data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization. The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv(), allowing it to be explored and cleaned systematically.

The script first performs basic data exploration, summarizing numerical columns with statistical metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation using df.describe() and providing similar insights for categorical columns. Additionally, it uses df.info() to inspect data types, memory usage, and the count of non-null values, while df.shape reveals the dataset's dimensions (rows and columns). To assess data quality, it calculates the number of unique values per column (df.nunique()) and identifies missing values both in absolute numbers (df.isnull().sum()) and percentages (df.isnull().mean() * 100).

To handle missing data, the code imputes numerical columns with their median values using df.fillna() and removes rows with missing values in the target column using df.dropna(). For categorical data encoding, it converts the 'Residence_type' column to binary values (0 for Rural, 1 for Urban) using map(). One-hot encoding is applied to the 'work_type' and 'smoking_status' columns, creating new binary columns for each unique category and dropping the original columns to avoid redundancy.

The script then saves the cleaned and encoded dataset to a new CSV file for later use in modeling. Following preprocessing, it generates five visualizations to analyze the data further. These include a histogram to show the distribution of the 'Age' column, a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical features, a bar chart for counts of encoded smoking statuses, a boxplot comparing age distributions across target categories, and a pie chart illustrating the proportion of rural vs. urban residence types.

Overall, this script thoroughly handles data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and visualization, making it suitable for preparing a dataset for machine learning or further analysis. Its modular structure ensures flexibility for adapting to various datasets and requirements.

This script follows a structured approach to data preprocessing and EDA, ensuring the dataset is ready for machine learning. It begins with exploration to understand the data, proceeds to clean and transform it to handle issues like missing values and categorical encoding, and ends with visualizations to uncover patterns. By combining these steps, the script provides a reliable and reusable framework for working with real-world datasets.

The initial steps focus on understanding the dataset. The script summarizes numerical columns with statistical metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation using describe() and examines categorical columns with a similar method, ensuring that both numerical and non-numerical insights are explored. To gain a complete picture, it uses info() to inspect data types, non-null counts, and memory usage, while the dataset's shape (rows and columns) is revealed with shape. Unique values per column are counted using nunique(), and missing values are assessed both in absolute terms (isnull().sum()) and as percentages (isnull().mean() * 100), identifying data quality issues.

Missing values are handled systematically. Numerical columns are imputed with their median values, a robust strategy against outliers, using fillna(). Rows with missing values in the target variable are dropped using dropna(), ensuring the integrity of the target column for supervised learning tasks. Categorical data is encoded to numerical formats suitable for analysis. The Residence_type column is binary-encoded into rural (0) and urban (1) categories using map(). For columns like work_type and smoking_status, one-hot encoding is applied, creating separate binary columns for each category. The original categorical columns are then dropped to avoid redundancy, and the final transformed dataset is saved to a new file for future use.

The script also emphasizes the importance of visualizing the data. It creates five distinct plots to reveal patterns and insights. A histogram with a KDE curve showcases the distribution of the Age column, while a heatmap visualizes correlations between numerical features, aiding feature selection. A bar chart displays the frequency distribution of encoded smoking statuses, and a boxplot compares age distributions across target categories, highlighting potential relationships. Finally, a pie chart illustrates the proportions of rural and urban residents, providing a clear understanding of the datasetâ€™s categorical distribution.

This end-to-end workflow ensures the dataset is thoroughly cleaned, transformed, and ready for analysis or modeling. By combining data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and visualization, this script serves as a reusable framework for working with diverse datasets, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications.
